This is just a simple script that deploys my dotfiles and some of the deps.

I highly advise not using this script at all.
There are many issues and it is far more worthwhile to use a different more
robust installer. (or better yet just do it yourself!)

That being said if you do want to try it out, you should at least know how to
download and install it yourself so I will not provide an actual tutorial.




### Basic programs:
- Window Manager: [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
- Terminal Emulator: [Foot](https://github.com/r-c-f/foot)
- Status Bar: [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- Menu: [Wofi](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/wofi)
- Shell: [zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)

### Included Programs:
- `swww` for wallpapers
- `swaylock` for a lock screen
- `mako` don't really know why I chose to try out this notif daemon but its here!
- `grim`, `slurp`, and `wl-clipboard` for screenshotting
- `ncmpcpp` nice terminal based mpd frontend
- `viewnior` image viewer
- `pipewire` needs no introduction
- `xdg-user-dirs` because i'm not insane
- `exa` awesome replacement for ls
- `bat` replacement for cat
- `lf` if you need a file manager for some reason
- `tere` for fun and fast navigation through your filesystem
- `librewolf` amazing webbrowser, de-mozilla'd firefox
- `starship` for a nicer looking prompt


### Included Theming:
- `Cattpuccin GTK Themes`
- `Cattpuccin Nvim Theme`
- `Cattpuccin Tmux theme`
- `starship pure prompt`

### Some included Neovim plugins:
- [Nvchad](https://nvchad.com/)
- `Rust tools`
- `Crates integration`
- `nvim-virtual-dap`

### Included zsh plugins:
- `zsh-you-should-use` tells you when you typed out a command that you already have an alias for
- `zsh-autosuggestions` adds autosuggestions based off previous commands

### Installation instructions!
Step 1. Don't.

Step 2. Profit.

### Warnings for those who do decide to install it even with every warning not to:
- This will only work on novideo 1000 series cards and higher 
- You will have problems with the desktop portal
- If you are using novideo make sure to read the Hyprland wiki on the topic | [Novideo page](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/)
- Tmux is not going to auto-enable all of the plugins, press CTRL+SPACE and then SHIFT+I to install them
